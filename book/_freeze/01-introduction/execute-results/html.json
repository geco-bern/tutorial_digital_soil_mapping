It focuses on uncovering patterns and relationships in geospatial data to gain insights into spatial phenomena. By integrating locational information, spatial data science provides a deeper understanding of complex spatial patterns and processes. There are three key aspects of spatial data science that allow such a deeper understanding:\n\n-   Spatial Data Visualization: Visualizing spatial data through maps and interactive visualizations helps communicate complex spatial information effectively.\n\n-   Spatial Data Analysis: Techniques such as spatial clustering, spatial autocorrelation analysis, and spatial regression reveal spatial patterns, trends, and dependencies.\n\n-   Geospatial Machine Learning: Applying machine learning algorithms to spatial data enables the creation of predictive models for spatially explicit predictions.\n\nCombined, working on each of these aspects, allows for a variety of real-world applications. For example, in urban planning, ecology, transportation, public health, and social sciences, we can apply similar methods to solve a problem. The knowledge inferred from maps, statistical analysis, and model prediction reveals fundamental processes to understand spatial relationships, and to eventually improve decision-making.\n\n<!--# ## Spatial Upscaling with Machine Learning Methods -->\n\n<!--# Spatial upscaling describes the process of extrapolating information from a smaller to a larger area. Spatial upscaling is used to solve the common problem where we have a variable of interest measured at a few sampling locations, whilst having large maps of potential covariates that could predict that variable. As discussed further below, this a variable of interest could be a soil characteristic that has to be sampled by digging up soil and analyzing it in the lab. Potential covariates are often remote-sensing data or pre-existing maps of e.g., geological features. Recent technological progress substantially facilitated the acquisition of remote-sensing data and in combination with increased computational capacity, we can use a variety of machine learning tools to investigate our variable of interest at larger scales. -->\n\n<!--# Although the field of spatial data science or geostatistics has gained great interest in recent years, our fundamental understanding rests on hundreds of years on decades of research. For example, quoting Waldo Tobler, a famous American-Swiss geographer, the first law of geography is that \"everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things\" [@tobler1970]. This is the essential idea of spatial autocorrelation. And because autocorrelation can hamper the validity of statistical analyses and modelling, we must account for it. However, this is not always straight-forward to do. Also, because of the rising use of global maps in scientific publications and in the media outlets that spread them, the trust-worthiness of global maps and communicating their uncertainties has become active scientific debate [@meyer2021; @meyer2022]. -->\n\n## A primer on soil science\n\nGenerally, any soil is the result of five key pedogenetic factors [@jenny1994]. Abbreviated, they can be simply memorized with the mnemonic \"CLORPT\": *soil = f(**CL**imate, **O**rganisms, topog**R**aphy, **P**arent material, **T**ime, ... )*. The \"*...*\" stands for additional factors, which have been recognized to be important factors but do not fall under the original CLORPT scheme. *soil* itself can stand for a variety of soil properties like its texture, density, pH, water drainage, cation exchange capacity, organic matter content, etc.\n\nDue to intensification of land use through agriculture and urbanization, soils across the world are increasingly under threat. Yet, soils provide crucial ecosystem services to us such as supporting our food system, draining water during heavy rainfalls, and storing massive amounts of carbon (see @fig-soil-functions). To quantify such services and to assess the risks associated with loosing soils, good maps are needed that provide information on where what soil service is delivered. Creating such maps through exhaustive sampling campaigns is however very costly and time-intensive. Also, such sampling campaigns provides only a snapshot of the historic and current state - they obviously cannot tell us anything about the soil's future. So, we have to take the next step and create spatial models that also provide us information on a soil's future and across large spatial scales.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Soil functions as defined per FAO, Figure taken from [Baveye et al. (2020)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenvs.2020.579904).](images/soil-functions.png){#fig-soil-functions width=554}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLuckily, the information on the CLORPT variables is often available at large continuous scale. For example, spatial data products for climate data or geological maps exist across large areas. And this information is highly useful to create models that can predict key soil properties and services at across the same area. If we can provide a robust model, we can massively simplify sampling efforts and inform decision-making processes in a cost- and labor-effective manner.\n\nNote that the variety in pedogenetic factors and soil properties comes with an equal variety of data types with variables being numerical (capped like % of clay content, or un-capped like organic matter content), binary (e.g., presence of water at 0-10 cm soil depth), categorical (more than two without an order), ordinal (more than two with an order), or interval (cutting numerical values into intervals). Moreover, this data can come in different data formats. Due to this abundance of data formats and their peculiarities, it is of great importance to properly understand your data. Only when you know your data well, you can pick a suitable statistical model to address your research question.\n\n## Case-Study: Digital Soil Mapping with Random Forests\n\nIn this tutorial, we are look at a specific case of spatial upscaling: digital soil mapping using Random Forests. This means that we want to predict soil properties that are difficult and laborious to obtain with a model that predicts such properties smoothly across space by exploiting available spatial data such as climate data. Here's a short check-list, what a good geo-spatial model should do. It should...\n\n-   ... capture non-linear relations because pedogenesis is a non-linear process.\n\n-   ... be able to use and predict continuous and categorical variables.\n\n-   ... handle multiple correlated variables without the risk of over-fitting.\n\n<!--# -   ... account for spatial auto-correlation (this is a bit tricky, so more on this in @sec-dataprep). -->\n\n-   ... build models with good predictive power.\n\n-   ... result in a sparse model, keeping only relevant predictors.\n\n-   ... quantify prediction accuracy and uncertainty.\n\nIn this tutorial, we use a dataset on basic soil properties from sampling locations across the canton of Bern and pair it up with climatic variables (temperature, precipitation, radiation), terrain attributes (derivatives from digital elevation models like slope, northness, eastness, topographic water index, etc.), geological maps, and soil maps [@nussbaum2018evaluation]. The following chapters will cover the preparation of this data (@sec-dataprep), fitting a Random Forest model (@sec-modelfit), and evaluating this model (@sec-modelanalysis). The final @sec-exercise holds the exercise description of this tutorial.\n\nIf you want to learn more about the underlying theory and similar techniques, we highly recommend the presentations by Madlene Nussbaum given at the summer school of the OpenGeoHub Foundation (see [part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgZ17CbL_xs) and [part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idkODq0BpAA)) and here papers ([@nussbaum2017, @nussbaum2018evaluation]).\n",
