The algorithm is designed as a wrapper around a Random Forest classification algorithm. It iteratively removes the features which are proved by a statistical test to be less relevant than random probes. The \&amp;lt;b\&amp;gt;Boruta\&amp;lt;/b\&amp;gt; package provides a convenient interface to the algorithm. The short description of the algorithm and examples of its application are presented.},
