    "text": "1.1 A primer on spatial data science\nSpatial data science combines geography, statistics, computer science, and data science to analyze and interpret spatially referenced data. It focuses on uncovering patterns and relationships in geospatial data to gain insights into spatial phenomena. By integrating locational information, spatial data science provides a deeper understanding of complex spatial patterns and processes. There are three key aspects of spatial data science that allow such a deeper understanding:\n\nSpatial Data Visualization: Visualizing spatial data through maps and interactive visualizations helps communicate complex spatial information effectively. A brief introduction to working with geospatial data in R is given here.\nSpatial Data Analysis: Techniques such as spatial clustering, spatial autocorrelation analysis, and spatial regression reveal spatial patterns, trends, and dependencies.\nGeospatial Machine Learning: Applying machine learning algorithms to spatial data enables the creation of predictive models for spatially explicit predictions.\n\nCombined, working on each of these aspects allows for a variety of real-world applications. For example, in urban planning, ecology, transportation, public health, and social sciences, we can apply similar methods to solve a problem. The knowledge inferred from maps, statistical analysis, and model prediction reveals fundamental processes to understand spatial relationships and to eventually improve decision-making."

    "section": "1.2 A primer on soil science",
    "text": "1.2 A primer on soil science\nGenerally, any soil is the result of five key pedogenetic factors (Jenny, 1994). Abbreviated, they can be simply memorized with the mnemonic “CLORPT”: soil = f(CLimate, Organisms, topogRaphy, Parent material, Time, … ). The “…” stands for additional factors, which have been recognized to be important factors but do not fall under the original CLORPT scheme. soil can stand for various soil properties like its texture, density, pH, water drainage, cation exchange capacity, organic matter content, etc.\nDue to the intensification of land use through agriculture and urbanization, soils across the world are increasingly under threat. Yet, soils provide crucial ecosystem services to us, such as supporting our food system, draining water during heavy rainfalls, and storing massive amounts of carbon (see Figure 1.1). To quantify such services and assess the risks associated with losing soils, good maps are needed to provide information on where soil service is delivered. Creating such maps through exhaustive sampling campaigns is very costly, time-intensive, and often at coarse temporal and spatial resolution. Also, such sampling campaigns provide only a snapshot of the historical and current state - they obviously cannot tell us anything about the soil’s future. So, there is a strong demand for models that provide us with information on a soil’s future across large spatial scales.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Soil functions as defined per FAO, Figure taken from Baveye et al. (2020).\n\n\n\n\nLuckily, information on the CLORPT variables is often available at large continuous scales, for example, spatial data products for climate data, digital elevation models, and geological maps. This information is highly useful for creating models that can predict key soil properties and services across the same area for which we have data. So, if we can produce a robust model, we can massively simplify sampling efforts, remove the need for hand-drawn maps, and inform decision-making processes in a cost- and labor-effective manner.\nThe increase in data abundance and computational resources and advances in statistics have put forward such statistical models. The use of Random Forests has gained a lot of traction due to being relatively simple whilst highly flexible (Hengl et al., 2018). Therefore, they are a perfect match for creating digital maps of all sorts of soil properties in a quick and simple manner.\nHowever, note that the variety in pedogenetic factors and soil properties comes with an equal variety of data types with variables being numerical (capped like % of clay content, or un-capped like organic matter content), binary (e.g., presence of water at 0-10 cm soil depth), categorical (more than two without an order), ordinal (more than two with an order), or interval (cutting numerical values into intervals). Moreover, this data can come in different data formats. Due to this abundance of data formats and their peculiarities, it is of great importance to properly understand your data. Only when you know your data well you can pick a suitable statistical model to address your research question."

    "text": "1.3 Case-Study: Digital Soil Mapping with Random Forests\nIn this tutorial, we are looking at a specific case of spatial upscaling: digital soil mapping using Random Forests. This means that we want to predict soil properties that are difficult and laborious to obtain with a model that predicts such properties smoothly across space by exploiting available spatial data such as climate data. Here’s a short checklist of what a good geo-spatial model should do. It should…\n\n… capture non-linear relations because pedogenesis is a non-linear process.\n… be able to use and predict continuous and categorical variables.\n… handle multiple correlated variables without the risk of over-fitting.\n\n\n\n… build models with good predictive power.\n… result in a sparse model, keeping only relevant predictors.\n… quantify prediction accuracy and uncertainty.\n\nIn the next chapters, we use a dataset on basic soil properties from sampling locations across the canton of Bern and pair it up with climatic variables (temperature, precipitation, radiation), terrain attributes (derivatives from digital elevation models like slope, northness, eastness, topographic water index, etc.), geological maps, and soil maps (Nussbaum et al., 2018). The following chapters will cover the preparation of this data (Chapter 2), fitting a Random Forest model (Chapter 3), and evaluating this model (Chapter 4). The final Chapter 5 holds the exercise description of this tutorial.\nIf you want to learn more about the underlying theory and similar techniques, we highly recommend the presentations by Madlene Nussbaum given at the summer school of the OpenGeoHub Foundation (see part 1 and part 2) and her papers: Nussbaum et al.

    "text": "2.2 Visualise data\nNow, let’s look at a visualisation of this raster file. Since we have selected the slope at 2 m resolution, we expect a relief-like map with a color gradient that indicates the steepness of the terrain. A quick way to look at a raster object is to use the generic plot() function.\n\n\nCode\n# Plot raster example\nterra::plot(raster_example)\n\n\n\n\n\nTo have more flexibility with visualising the data, we can use the ggplot() in combination with the {tidyterra} package.\n\n\nCode\n# To have some more flexibility, we can plot this in the ggplot-style as such:\nggplot() +\n  tidyterra::geom_spatraster(data = raster_example) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(\n    na.value = NA,\n    option = \"magma\",\n    name = \"Slope (%) \\n\"\n  ) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) + # avoid gap between plotting area and axis\n  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +\n  labs(title = \"Slope of the Study Area\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nNote that the second plot has different coordinates than the upper one. That is because the data was automatically projected to the World Geodetic System (WGS84, ESPG: 4326).\n\n\nThis looks already interesting but we can put our data into a bit more context. For example, a larger map background would be useful to get a better orientation of our location. Also, it would be nice to see where our sampling locations are and to differentiate these locations by whether they are part of the training or testing dataset. Bringing this all together requires some more understanding of plotting maps in R. So, don’t worry if you do not understand everything in the code chunk below and enjoy the visualizations:\n\n\nCode\n# To get our map working correctly, we have to ensure that all the input data\n# is in the same coordinate system.

At a first glance, it is a bit crowded but once you zoom in, you can investigate our study area quite nicely. You can check whether the slope raster file makes sense by comparing it against the base maps. Can you see how cliffs along the Aare river, hills, and even gravel quarries show high slope values. We also see that our testing dataset is randomly distributed across the area covered by the training dataset."

    "text": "2.3 Combine data\nNow that we have played with a few visualizations, let’s get back to preparing our data. The {terra} package comes with the very useful tool to stack multiple rasters on top of each other if they share the spatial grid (extent and resolution). To do so, we just have to feed in the vector of file names list_raster:\n\n\nCode\n# Load all files as one batch\nall_rasters &lt;- rast(list_raster)\nall_rasters\n\n\nclass       : SpatRaster \nsize        : 986, 2428, 91  (nrow, ncol, nlyr)\nresolution  : 20, 20  (x, y)\nextent      : 2568140, 2616700, 1200740, 1220460  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)\ncoord. ref. : CH1903+ / LV95 \nsources     : NegO.tif  \n              PosO.tif  \n              Se_MRRTF2m.tif  \n              ... and 88 more sources\nnames       :      NegO,      PosO, Se_MRRTF2m, Se_MRVBF2m, Se_NO2m_r500, Se_PO2m_r500, ... \nmin values  : 0.8109335, 0.8742412,   0.000000,   0.000000,    0.2755551,    0.3541574, ... \nmax values  : 1.5921584, 1.6218545,   6.965698,   7.991423,    1.6376855,    1.6430260, ... \n\n\nNote that above, we have stacked only a random of all available raster data (list_raster) which we have generated previously.\nNow, we do not want to have the covariates’ data from all cells in the raster file. Rather, we want to reduce our stacked rasters to the x and y coordinates for which we have soil sampling data. We can do this using the terra::extract() function from the {terra} package. Then, we want to merge the two dataframes of soil data and covariates data by their coordinates. Since number of rows and the order of the covariate data is the same as the “Bern data” (soil samples), we can simply bind their columns with bind_rows():\n\n\nCode\n# Extract coordinates from

    "text": "2.5 Checking missing data\nWe are almost done with our data preparation, we just need to reduce it to sampling locations for which we have a decent amount of data on the covariates. Else, we blow up the model calibration with data that is not informative enough.\n\n\nCode\n# Get number of rows to calculate percentages\nn_rows &lt;- nrow(df_full)\n\n# Get number of distinct values per variable\ndf_full |&gt;\n  summarise(across(\n    everything(),\n    ~ length(.) - sum(is.na(.))\n  )) |&gt;\n  tidyr::pivot_longer(everything(),\n    names_to = \"variable\",\n    values_to = \"n\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(perc_available = round(n / n_rows * 100)) |&gt;\n  arrange(perc_available) |&gt;\n  head(10) |&gt;\n  knitr::kable()\n\n\n\n\n\nvariable\nn\nperc_available\n\n\n\n\nph.30.50\n856\n81\n\n\nph.10.30\n866\n82\n\n\nph.50.100\n859\n82\n\n\ntimeset\n871\n83\n\n\nph.0.10\n870\n83\n\n\ndclass\n1006\n96\n\n\nsite_id_unique\n1052\n100\n\n\nx\n1052\n100\n\n\ny\n1052\n100\n\n\ndataset\n1052\n100\n\n\n\n\n\nThis looks good, we have no variable with a substantial amount of missing data. Generally, only pH measurements are lacking, which we should keep in mind when making predictions and inferences. Another great way to explore your data, is using the {visdat} package:\n\n\nCode\ndf_full |&gt;\n  dplyr::select(1:20) |&gt; # reduce data for readability of the plot\n  visdat::vis_miss()\n\n\n\n\n\nAlright, we see that we are not missing any data in the covariate data. Mostly sampled data, specifically pH and timeset data is missing. We also see that this missing data is mostly from the same entries, so if we keep only entries where we have pH data - which is what we are interested in here - we have a dataset with pracitally no missing data."

    "text": "3.2 Preparations\nBefore we can fit the model, we have to specify a few settings. First, we have to specify our target and predictor variables. Then, we have to split our dataset into a training and a testing set. Random Forest models cannot deal with NA values, so we have to remove these from our training set.\nIn the dataset we work with here, the data splitting into training and testing sets is defined by the column dataset. Usually, this is not the case and we split the data ourselves. Have a look at the section in AGDS Book on data splitting.\nAs predictors_all we use all the variables for which we have data with spatial coverage - the basis for spatial upscaling.

See here for more background on OOB error estimation with Random Forests.\nThis is the step at which you may want to reduce the number of predictors_all to avoid collinearity and the risk of overfitting. You may also want to optimize the hyperparameters for improving the model performance and generalisability. Different hyperparameter specifications of the Random Forest model that control the model complexity may be compared. A simple way to do that is to use the {caret} R package which provides machine learning wrapper functions for hyperparameter tuning (among many more functionalities). Its use in combination with Random Forest is demonstrated in Chapter 11 of AGDS book. Reducing the number of predictors_all and retaining only the most important ones is important for obtaining robust model generalisability and is approached by what is shown below."

    "text": "3.4 Variable importance\nOur model has 91 variables, but we don’t know anything about their role in influencing the model predictions and how important they are for achieving good predictions. ranger() provides a built-in functionality for quantifying variable importance based on the OOB-error. This functionality can be controlled with the argument importance. When set to 'permutation', the algorithm randomly permutes values of each variable, one at a time, and measures the importance as the resulting decrease in the OOB prediction skill of each decision tree within the Random Forest and returns the average across importances of all decision trees. Note that this is a model-specific variable importance quantification method. In AGDS Book Chapter 12, you have learned about a model model-agnostic method.\nThe model object returned by the ranger() function stores the variable importance information. The code below accesses this information and sorts the predictor variables with decreasing importance. If the code runs slow, you can also use the faster impurity method (see more information here).\n\n\nCode\n# Let's run the basic model again but with recording the variable importance\nrf_basic &lt;- ranger(\n  y = df_train[, target],     # target variable\n  x = df_train[, predictors_all], # Predictor variables\n  importance = \"permutation\", # Pick permutation to calculate variable importance\n  seed = 42, # Specify seed for randomization to reproduce the same model again\n  num.threads = parallel::detectCores() - 1\n) # Use all but one CPU core for quick model training\n\n# Extract the variable importance and create a long tibble\nvi_rf_basic &lt;- rf_basic$variable.importance |&gt;\n  bind_rows() |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = \"variable\")\n\n# Plot variable importance, ordered by decreasing value\ngg &lt;- vi_rf_basic |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(variable, value), y = value)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"grey50\", width = 0.75) +\n  labs(\n    y = \"Change in OOB MSE after permutation\",\n    x = \"\",\n    title = \"Variable importance based on OOB\"\n  ) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  coord_flip()\n\n# Display plot\ngg\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do we see here? The higher the value, the stronger the effect of permutation on the model performance, the more important the variable. The five most important variables are the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportance rank\nVariable name\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n1\nmt_rr_y\nMean annual precipitation\n\n\n2\nmt_tt_y\nMean annual temperature\n\n\n3\nmt_td_y\nMean annual dew point temperature\n\n\n4\nmt_gh_y\nMean annual incoming radiation\n\n\n5\nbe_gwn25_vdist\nHorizontal distance to water body at 25m resolution\n\n\n\nWe find that the mean annual precipitation is by far the most important variable in determining soil pH in our model. From a soil-forming perspective, this seems plausible (Dawson, 1977). We further find that the four most important variables all describe climate - reflecting its important role as a soil-forming factor. Most of the remaining variables are metrics of the topography. It should also be noted that many of them may be correlated since. Some of them measure the same aspect of topography, but derived from a digital elevation model given at different spatial resolution (see Chapter 6). Due to their potential correlation, dropping one of the affected variables from the model may thus not lead to a strong deterioration of the model skill as its (correlated) information is still contained in the remaining variables."

    "text": "3.5 Variable selection\nThe large number of variables in our model and the tendency that many of them exhibit a low importance in comparison to the dominating few, and that they may be correlated calls for a variable selection. Reducing the number of predictors_all reduces the risk that remaining predictors_all are correlated. Having correlated predictors_all is a problem - as shown in the context of spatial upscaling by (Ludwig et al., 2023). Intuitively, this makes sense in view of the fact that if \\(x_i\\) and \\(x_j\\) are correlated, then, for example, \\(x_i\\) is used for modelling its true association with the target variable, while \\(x_j\\) can be “spent” to model randomly occurring covariations with the target - potentially modelling noise in the data. If this happens, overfitting will follow (see here).\nDifferent strategies for reducing the number of predictors_all, while retaining model performance and improving model generalisability, exist. Greedy search, or stepwise regression are often used. Their approach is to sequentially add (stepwise forward) or remove (stepwise backward) predictors_all and to determine the best (complemented or reduced) set of predictors_all in terms of respective model performance at each step. The algorithm stops once the model starts to deteriorate or stops improving. However, it should be noted that these algorithms don’t assess all possible combinations of predictors_all and may thus not find the “globally” optimal model. A stepwise regression was implemented in AGDS I as a Report Exercise (see here).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTo dig deeper into understanding how the model works, we could further investigate its partial dependence plots (see here).\n\n\nAn alternative approach to model selection is to consider the variable importance. predictors_all may be selected based on whether removing their association with the target variable (by permuting values of the predictor) deteriorates the model. Additionally, a decision criterion can be introduced for determining whether or not to retain the respective variable. This is implemented by the “Boruta-Algorithm” - an effective and popular approach to variable selection (Kursa & Rudnicki, 2010). Boruta is available as an R package {Boruta}, is based on Random Forests, and performs a permutation of variables for determining their importance - as described in Chapter 12 of AGDS Book for model-agnostic variable importance estimation. The algorithm finally categorizes variables into \"Rejected\", \"Tentative\", and \"Confirmed\". Let’s apply Boruta on our data.\n\n\nCode\nset.seed(42)\n\n# run the algorithm\nbor &lt;- Boruta::Boruta(\n  y = df_train[, target],\n  x = df_train[, predictors_all],\n  maxRuns = 50, # Number of iterations.

Here are a few hints as a guide:\n\nMake sure that the categorical target variable is encoded as a factor using the function factor().\nStart with a model that includes all predictors, trained on the pre-defined training subset.\nEvaluate the model on the testing subset of the data. Consider appropriate metrics as described in AGDS Book 9.4.1.2. Is the data balanced in terms of observed TRUE and FALSE values? What does this imply for the interpretation of the different metrics?"

Using the training data subset, implement a 5-fold cross-validation to optimise the hyperparameters mtry and min.node.size of the same Random Forest model as implemented above. You may use the {caret} library as demonstrated in AGDS Book. Evaluate the optimized model on the test set using the same metrics as considered above. Does the model generalise better to unseen data than the initial model (which used default hyperparameters, see ?ranger::ranger)."

    "text": "5.4 Probabilistic predictions\nUsing the optimised (or if you didn’t manage - the initial default) hyperparameters, train the Random Forest model, setting ranger::ranger(..., probability = TRUE). This yields not a model predicting a binary class, but a probability of the target to be TRUE. This lets the user chose where to put the threshold for translating a probability to a binary class. E.g., if the predicted probability is \\(&gt;0.5\\), then consider this as a prediction of TRUE. Establish the Reicever-operating-characteristic curve, as described in AGDS Book Chapter 9.4.1.2.\nConsider you inform an infrastructure construction project where waterlogged soils severely jeopardize the stability of the building. Then, consider you inform a project where waterlogged soils are unwanted, but not critical. In both cases, your prediction map of a binary classification is used as a basis and the binary classification is derived from the probabilistic prediction. How would you chose the threshold in each case? Would you chose the same threshold in both cases? If not, explain why. Can you think of an analogy of a similarly-natured problem in another realm?"
